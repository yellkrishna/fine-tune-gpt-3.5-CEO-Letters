The language model is accessed using OpenAI’s API. The model is first fine-tuned using two of the three training datasets provided with the leftover dataset used as a validation set. We check the predicted dimensions for the validation dataset and compare it with the true values. Similarly, we also predict the dimensions for in-sample data and compare with their true values. The accuracy of the prediction is calculated.\n",
